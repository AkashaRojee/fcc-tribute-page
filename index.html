                Chuck Schuldiner was born on 13 May 1967 in New York. The following year, his family moved to Florida.
                <br><br>
                At the age of 9, after the death of his brother, Chuck picked up guitar and mostly learnt by himself. His early teens saw his first public performance.
                <br><br>
                In 1983, Chuck Schuldiner formed the band Mantas with Rick DeLillo and him on guitars, and Kam Lee on drums and vocals. The following year, he renamed Mantas to Death and started on vocals. In 1986, he moved to Toronto and temporarily joined the band Slaughter, but returned to Florida after a few weeks.

                Death's lineup underwent any changes, including musicians such as Steve DiGiorgio (Testament), Chris Reifert (Autopsy), Terry Butler (Obituary), Bill Andrews (Massacre) and James Murphy.
                <br><br>
                From 1987 to 1998, Death released several albums: Scream Bloody Gore, Leprosy, Spiritual Healing, Human, Individual Thought Patterns, Symbolic, and The Sound Of Perseverance. Human was Death's breakthrough album, with a more technical and progressive style, which continued on the remaining albums.
                <br><br>
                Chuck also worked on a more melodic band project, Control Denied, with some previous Death members, and vocalist Tim Aymar.
                <br><br>
                In May 1999, Chuck was diagnosed with brain cancer. His family struggled with the medical bills and several fundraisers were held to help cover the costs. He battled with the disease while writing new material for Control Denied. 2 years later, the illness worsened. On 13 December 2001, he passed away, at the age of 34.
